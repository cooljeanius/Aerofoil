Many Glider PRO houses, including the bundled ones, contain images in QuickDraw
PICT format in the game resource data.

PICT is a very complex format, many of its features are not completely
documented, and some PICT features are impossible to support because they
require copyrighted pattern sets and fonts that are bundled with the
operating system.

My goal is to support as many community houses as possible, but there is a
point where supporting the format is more work than just manually converting
the resources on a Macintosh machine or emulator.

All of the remaining known unsupported features necessary to decode the
remaining cases are only used by one house that I'm aware of each.

Known error codes:

Code 5 subcode 25: Strange image channel layout
Code 8 subcode 145: Unsupported BitsRgn opcode.
Code 8 subcode 40960: Undocumented opcode, possibly a format parsing error.

Code 8 subcode 34: Unsupported ShortLine opcode. (PICT contains vector graphics.)
Code 8 subcode 35: Unsupported ShortLineFrom opcode. (PICT contains vector graphics.)
Code 8 subcode 49: Unsupported PaintRect opcode. (PICT contains vector graphics.)
Code 8 subcode 51: Unsupported PaintOval opcode. (PICT contains vector graphics.)
Code 8 subcode 129: paintRgn opcode. (PICT contains vector graphics.)
Code 8 subcode 33280: Unsupported CompressedQuickTime opcode.  (PICT contains a QuickTime frame.)
Code 8 subcode 33281: Unsupported UncompressedQuickTime opcode.  (PICT contains a QuickTime frame.)
