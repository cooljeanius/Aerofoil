Linux support is IN ALPHA and may or may not work.

Use these basic steps to build and install Aerofoil:
- Ensure dependencies are installed - all of these are likely available from
  your distribution's package manager:
    - CMake 3.10 or later (https://cmake.org/download/)
    - SDL 2.0.12 or later (https://libsdl.org)
    - FreeType 2.10.1 or later (https://freetype.org/download.html)
- Change directory to the Aerofoil source root (the directory containing this file)
- Run "cmake -B build" to create a CMake build tree under "build"
- Run "cmake --build build" to build the AerofoilX program and its resources
- Run "cmake --install build" to install everything under /usr/local
- You can now run Aerofoil with the command "AerofoilX"

You can also build just the AerofoilX executable and use the prebuilt resources
from the Windows release:
- Follow the steps above, ignoring the FreeType dependency and stopping after
  running "cmake -B build"
- Run "cmake --build build --target Executable" to build only the executable
- Run "cmake --install build --component Executable" to install AerofoilX in
  /usr/local/bin
- Download the Windows build from
  https://github.com/elasota/Aerofoil/releases/latest and unzip it
- Create the directory /usr/local/lib/aerofoil and copy the "Packaged"
  directory from the Windows build into it

To install under a prefix other than /usr/local add
"-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>" to "cmake -B build"

Tools for converting Glider PRO houses are installed under
/usr/local/lib/aerofoil/tools, see Documentation/userhouses.txt for
instructions on how to use them.

The main AerofoilX executable, its required resources and the conversion tools
can be built and installed individually via these build targets and install
components:
- Executable
- Resources
- Tools

For instance, you can use
    cmake --build build --target Executable Resources
to build only Aerofoil and its resources, and
    cmake --install build --component Executable
    cmake --install build --component Resources
to install them.

GitHub.
