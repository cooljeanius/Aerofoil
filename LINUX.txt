Linux support is IN ALPHA and may or may not work.  Only Cygwin has been
tested so far.

You can attempt the following:
- Install CMake (https://cmake.org/download/)
- Install SDL 2.0.12 or higher, or build it from the included source
- Run "cmake ." in the Aerofoil source directory
- Run "make install" to build the AerofoilX program
- Unzip the the Windows build
- Copy the "Packaged" and "Resources" directories from the Windows build into
  the "lib" folder above the "bin" folder that the AerofoilX program installed
  to.  For example, if it installed to /usr/local/bin/, then the data files
  should go in /usr/local/lib/aerofoil/
- Run AerofoilX
